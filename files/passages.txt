The resulting abnormally phosphorylated PrPsc aggregates to freshly synthesized PrPc, transforming it into same; due to a system of positive feedback invoked by the organophosphate-induced blockage of a prion protein-specific protein kinase.!
The protein kinase C specific inhibitor Go-6983 further enhanced the inhibitory effect of VACM-1 on AVP-stimulated cAMP production!
The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms
Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly
Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point
The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate
Intracerebroventricular injections of 200 ng oxytocin caused a significant rise not only of insulin but also of glucagon and glucose levels
In contrast, nanogram amounts of oxytocin administered ICV cause a rise of insulin levels!
Induction of fatty acid translocase/CD36, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in human subcutaneous fat by lipid infusion
Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the mRNA expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and UCP-3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was investigated in gluteal subcutaneous fat biopsies before and after 5 h infusions of saline or Intralipid (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Milan, Italy) plus heparin, which does not modify insulinemia
Marked increases in FAT/CD36 (724+/-18%; P < 0.05), PPAR-gamma2 (200+/-8%; P < 0.05), leptin (110+/-13%; P < 0.05), UCP-2 (120+/-7%; P < 0.05), UCP-3 (80+/-5%; P < 0.05), and TNF-alpha mRNA (130+/-12%; P < 0.05) were observed in comparison with pretreatment levels, whereas there was no change after saline infusion
These data suggest that the in vivo gene expression of FAT/CD36, PPAR-gamma2, leptin, UCP-2, UCP-3, and TNF-alpha in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by circulating lipids independent of insulin and that prolonged hyperlipidemia may therefore contribute to increased fat metabolism and storage as a result of the increased expression of these proteins!
UCP2, UCP3 and leptin gene expression: modulation by food restriction and leptin
To determine the effects of food restriction and leptin administration on several transcripts involved in energy homeostasis, we examined leptin, uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1, 2 and 3, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), beta3-adrenergic receptors (beta3AR) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal (EWAT) and perirenal (PWAT) white adipose tissue in three groups of rats
Leptin increased LPL mRNA by 80%, UCP1 mRNA twofold, and UCP3 mRNA levels by 62% in BAT, and increased UCP2 mRNA levels twofold in EWAT
The present study indicates that leptin increases the gene expression of UCP2 in EWAT and that of UCP1, UCP3 and LPL in BAT, whereas reduced food consumption but not leptin, decreases LPL expression in WAT!
We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells
In these cells, AVP also causes the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date
Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH
We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.!
The effects of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inositol phosphate (IP) generation in human myometrial cells were evaluated and compared to the effects of oxytocin
In contrast, the potencies of oxytocin to raise IP and [Ca2+]i were similar and independent of extracellular Ca2+, and could be suppressed by pertussis toxin and phorbol ester, but not by verapamil
The action of PGF2 alpha depends on extracellular Ca2+, whereas oxytocin activates the G-protein-dependent phospholipase-C-IP3-Ca2+ signal-transducing pathway, complemented by the influx of extracellular Ca2+!
These findings led us to conclude that inositol trisphosphate [corrected] causes Ca2+ mobilization by muscarinic activation of PLC, leading to intracellular translocation of insulin granules to the ready-releasable pool in pancreatic beta-cells via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chains!
Interleukin-1 beta inhibits phospholipase C and insulin secretion at sites apart from KATP channel
Surprisingly, however, when islets were depolarized directly using either of two agonists, glyburide (which does not act via generation of purine nucleotides) or 40 mM K+ (which acts distal to KATP channel), PLC and insulin secretion were again obliterated by IL-1 beta
These data (together with the finding that IL-1 beta inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release) suggest that, in addition to its effects on ATP synthesis and thereby on the KATP channel, IL-1 beta has at least two undescribed, distal effects to block both PLC as well as Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis!
The experiments were concluded by taking blood samples for later analysis of plasma glucose and plasma levels of the following hormones: insulin, gastrin, CCK, glucagon, somatostatin, oxytocin and corticosterone
The low-performing Stock B animals were characterized by [1] being more reactive to sensory stimulation: higher startle amplitude and shorter startle latency; [2] having higher plasma insulin and corticosterone levels, whereas plasma gastrin and oxytocin were significantly lowered and a strong tendency for a decrease also in plasma CCK!
To explore the possible roles of the hypothalamic melanocortin system in leptin action, we examined the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of leptin with or without SHU9119, a potent antagonist of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, on food intake, body weight, and mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) mRNA expression in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in rats
A single i.c.v. injection of leptin decreased cumulative food intake and body weight gain, and increased UCP-1 mRNA expression during 3 h at the onset of the dark phase
Co-injection of SHU9119 also inhibited completely the leptin-induced increase in UCP-1 mRNA expression in the BAT!
Insulin stimulates the release of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane dipeptidase from 3T3-L1 adipocytes through the action of a phospholipase C
The hydrophilic form of MDP released from the cells on stimulation with insulin was recognized by antibodies against the inositol 1,2-cyclic monophosphate cross-reacting determinant, indicating that it had been generated by cleavage of its GPI anchor through the action of a phospholipase C!
In normal pancreatic islets, UCP-2 is upregulated by leptin and is low in leptin-resistant islets of ZDF rats
To determine whether UCP-2 does, in fact, have uncoupling activity and, if so, whether such activity would favorably influence the abnormalities in leptin-unresponsive UCP-2-underexpressing islets of diabetic ZDF rats, we transferred the UCP-2 gene to the islets of diabetic ZDF rats and lean (+/+) ZDF control rats
We conclude that UCP-2 has uncoupling function when overexpressed in leptin-insensitive islets and that its overexpression corrects the underexpression of the insulin gene and ameliorates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, possibly by increasing the ATP:ADP ratio!
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and oxytocin binding in human myometrium!
Involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of intracerebroventricular leptin infusion on uncoupling protein-3 expression in rat muscle
A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3
To further substantiate an involvement of thyroid hormones in the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression, hypothyroid rats were ICV infused with leptin or vehicle
It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls
These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression!
Similarly, carbachol, but not AVP or DDAVP, induced a significant increase in membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme activity
In contrast, AVP had no effect on the distribution of any PKC isoform tested!
An inhibitor of PKC, Ro31-8220 (10 microM), abolished the ability of PDBu to decrease [Ca(2+)](i), without affecting the response to maximal or submaximal concentrations of AVP!
The relative risks between highest and lowest quarters of flavonoid intake adjusted for age, smoking, serum cholesterol concentration, blood pressure, and body mass index were 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.90) and 0.54 (0.33 to 0.87) for total and coronary mortality, respectively!
However, in brown fat, we observed a 2-3-fold increase in the expression of UCP1 in response to dietary fat challenge, which may be related to diet-induced elevations in plasma leptin levels!
The expression of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 were up-regulated by 3.2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, during the late stage of pregnancy with an increase of WAT leptin mRNA expression and exogenous administration of leptin resulted in induction of the uterine UCP2 and UCP3 levels
These results indicate that UCP gene expressions during pregnancy are regulated tissue-dependently, and up-regulation of uterine UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA may be due to increased leptin levels!
Amyloid beta protein (25-35) stimulation of phospholipases A, C and D activities of LA-N-2 cells
[3H]Inositol prelabeled LA-N-2 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of A beta P, from 20 to 125 micrograms/ml, and phospholipase C activation was measured
The effects of adrenergic, metabotropic amino acid and bombesin antagonists on the A beta P mediated stimulation of phospholipase C activity was investigated
Propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist, 7-chloro-kynurenic acid, a metabotropic amino acid antagonist, and [Tyr4-D-Phe12]bombesin, a bombesin antagonist, blunted the A beta P stimulation of phospholipase C activity in [3H]inositol prelabeled LA-N-2 cells
This suggests that amyloid beta protein activation of phospholipase C may be receptor mediated
The phospholipase C inhibitor U 71322 prevented the activation of phospholipase C by A beta P!
The ARC NPY neurones are stimulated by starvation, probably mediated by falls in circulating leptin and insulin (which both inhibit these neurones), and contribute to the increased hunger in this and other conditions of energy deficit
ARC NPY neurones also mediate hyperphagia and obesity in the ob/ob and db/db mice and fa/fa rat, in which leptin inhibition is lost through mutations affecting leptin or its receptor!
The glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored protein, membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.19) is released from the surface of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to insulin treatment through the action of a phospholipase C
Although X-Pro aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.9) is GPI-anchored in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as shown by digestion with bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, it was not released upon insulin treatment of the cells, indicating that only a subset of the GPI-anchored proteins are susceptible to insulin-stimulated release!
A neurotoxic fragment of amyloid, Abeta 25-35, incubated in the presence of endogenous Ca2+, increased significantly the PI-PLC activity of normoxic brain
In its non-aggregated form, Abeta 25-35 activates PI-PLC but in the aggregated form the enzymatic activity decreased
Thus, Abeta 25-35 exerts a similar effect on the membrane-bound PI-PLC from normoxic brain or subjected to ischemia reperfusion injury
Ischemia-reperfusion injury had no effect on Abeta-evoked alterations of synaptic plasma membrane-bound PI-PLC!
They are needed for the catabolism of cholesterol, bile acids, and steroid hormones; they hydrolyze a number of flavonoid glycosides to anticarcinogens; and they detoxify certain carcinogens!
The effect of leptin in adult rats appears to be exerted at hypothalamic level by regulating growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), somatostatin and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-producing neurones!
Interestingly, both 5-HT and leptin modulate the action of NPY, which may form a part of a common output pathway for the expression of appetite!
METHODS: We have therefore studied possible associations of the Gln27Glu and the Gly16Arg polymorphisms in the beta2AR with BMI, plasma leptin and UCP-1 mRNA expression in the intraperitoneal adipose tissue in a population of Caucasian women
Furthermore, no association was found between the Gln27Glu or the Gly16Arg polymorphisms and plasma leptin or adipose tissue UCP-1 gene expression in either group!
Finally, recent evidences suggest that melanocortins could be involved in mediating the effects of leptin, and in controlling the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY)!
Aggregated beta amyloid peptide 1-40 decreases Ca2+- and cholinergic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide degradation by alteration of membrane and cytosolic phospholipase C in brain cortex
The effects of full-length amyloid beta protein, A(beta) (1-40), on phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) were investigated in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) and cytosol prepared from the cerebral cortex of adult rats
Aggregated A(beta) also decreased significantly the level of diacylglycerol, the product of PLC
This additionally supports the inhibitory effect of A(beta) on membrane-bound and cytosolic PLC
Moreover, A(beta) (1-40) significantly decreased the basal activity of the PIP2-PLC in SPM and the enzyme activity regulated through cholinergic receptors!
Insulin-induced phospholipase D1 and phospholipase D2 activity in human embryonic kidney-293 cells mediated by the phospholipase Cgamma and protein kinase Calpha signalling cascade.
Co-expression of PLD1 with phospholipase C (PLC)gamma has the same effect, while co-expression of PLD2 with PLCgamma allows PLD2 activity to be stimulated in an insulin-dependent manner.
The PKC-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and Go 6976 abolish insulin-induced PLD2 activation in HEK-293 cells co-expressing the insulin receptor, PLCgamma and PLD2, confirming that not only PLD1, but PLD2 as well, is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner.
In summary, we demonstrate that insulin treatment results in activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in appropriate cell types when the appropriate upstream intermediate signalling components, i.e. PKCalpha and PLCgamma, are expressed at sufficient levels.!
Leptin and UCP (1 and 2) mRNA levels were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methodology in adipose tissue and gastrocnemius muscle
A negative correlation between WAT O2 consumption and UCP2 expression was found in control animals, but not in the cafeteria-fed groups, suggesting a differential response to the beta3-adrenergic compound in lean and obese animals, which is in agreement with the reported statistical interactions between obesity and Trecadrine administration found for WAT O2 consumption and muscle UCP2 expression, as well as for plasma leptin and WAT leptin expression!
We previously showed that arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulates heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) induction through protein kinase C activation in aortic smooth muscle A10 cells
Calphostin C and ET-18-OCH(3), inhibitors of protein kinase C, reduced the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase by AVP!
Treatment with (+)-trifluoro-ABA strongly inhibited the gibberellic acid-inducible expression of alpha-amylase I-1 encoded by RAmy1A in the aleurone layers of embryoless half-seeds at the levels of transcription, protein synthesis, and enzyme activity!
Amyloid beta peptide 25-35 modulates hydrolysis of phosphoinositides by membrane phospholipase(s) C of adult brain cortex
Fresh-water-soluble A beta 25-35 activated PI-PLC in SPM markedly by two- to threefold, but this effect was absent in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2
Moreover, A beta 25-35 had no effect on basal PIP2-PLC activity and cytosolic PI-PLC and PIP2-PLC
The aggregated form of A beta 25-35 significantly inhibited PIP2-PLC only in the presence of endogenous CaCl2!
Concurrent decrease of vasopressin and protein kinase Calpha immunoreactivity during the light phase in the vole suprachiasmatic nucleus
Mean numbers of AVP- and protein kinase Calpha-immunoreactive neurons were determined in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of common voles, entrained to a 12:12 h light-dark (LD) cycle, at the beginning of the light period (zeitgeber time zero) and 6 h later (zeitgeber time six)
At zeitgeber time zero, mean numbers of AVP- and protein kinase Calpha- immunoreactive neurons were 2194 and 9897, respectively!
The deduced consensus closely resembled gibberellin response elements in alpha-amylase promoters!
Roles of GTP and phospholipase C in the potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion by glucose in rat pancreatic islets
There was a 98% greater augmentation of insulin secretion by 16.7 mM glucose (in the presence of diazoxide and 40 mM K+) in primed islets; however, the ability of high glucose to augment PLC activity bore no relationship to the secretory response
MPA markedly inhibited PLC in both conditions; however, insulin secretion was only inhibited (by 46%) in primed islets
These data indicate that an adequate level of GTP is critical for glucose's potentiation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion in primed islets but that PLC activation can clearly be dissociated from insulin secretion and therefore cannot be the major cause of glucose's augmentation of Ca(2+)-induced insulin secretion!
Oxytocin-stimulated insulin release in a clonal beta-cell line RINm5F: involvement of phospholipase C-dependent and -independent pathways.
CONCLUSION: Oxy increases insulin release through both PLC and non-PLC mediated signal transduction mechanisms.
In addition, U-73122 diminished the Oxy-induced increase in intracellular concentration of inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3)
U-73122 at 8 mumol.L-1 totally abolished the Oxy-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3; however it reduced the Oxy-induced increase in insulin release only by 36% and 63% in the monolayer and suspended cell preparations, respectively
Oxytocin-stimulated insulin release in a clonal beta-cell line RINm5F: involvement of phospholipase C-dependent and -independent pathways
AIM: To study the mechanisms underlying oxytocin (Oxy)-induced insulin release
RESULTS: Oxy increased insulin release and [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner
Oxy-induced insulin release was not altered by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PT)
U-73122 at 8 mumol.L-1 totally abolished the Oxy-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3; however it reduced the Oxy-induced increase in insulin release only by 36% and 63% in the monolayer and suspended cell preparations, respectively
CONCLUSION: Oxy increases insulin release through both PLC and non-PLC mediated signal transduction mechanisms!
Recently several significant advances have been made in this area, including the identification of the appetite regulating hormone, leptin, and a detailed understanding of its targets in the central nervous system (CNS), such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the melanocortin-4 receptor!
Constitutive expression of PKABA1 drastically suppressed expression of low- and high-pI alpha-amylase and protease genes induced by GA!
Effects of oxytocin, arginine-vasopressin and lysine-vasopressin on insulin and glucagon secretion in sheep
The effects of the posterior-pituitary peptides oxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and lysine-vasopressin (LVP) on insulin and glucagon secretion were examined in adult sheep
The maximal insulin responses induced by OT and AVP were very similar, but the threshold and maximal doses of AVP for increasing plasma insulin were higher than those of OT!
Downregulation of uncoupling protein 2 mRNA in white adipose tissue and uncoupling protein 3 mRNA in skeletal muscle during the early stages of leptin treatment
Leptin by intravenous or intracerebroventricular infusion for 5 h was associated with a decrease in UCP-2 mRNA in WAT (47-52%) and UCP-3 mRNA in SM (33-37%)
Denervation suppressed mRNA levels for UCP-2 (49%), UCP-3 (36%), and COX-IV (59%) and eliminated the acute response to leptin in SM!
Influence of obesity and menopausal status on serum leptin, cholecystokinin, galanin and neuropeptide Y levels
Obesity occurs in 60% of women after menopause and is characterized by an excess of adipose tissue that depends on several orexigenic (neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates carbohydrate ingestion, galanin stimulates fat intake) and anorectic (leptin, cholecystokinin (CCK)) factors
Both leptin and insulin can reduce hypothalamic NPY production and secretion
We investigated basal levels of serum leptin, CCK, galanin and NPY in 16 non-obese premenopausal women, in 15 obese premenopausal women (body mass index (BMI) 34.6 +/- 1.3 SD) and in ten obese postmenopausal women (BMI 34.7 +/- 1.5 SD) to determine the relationship between obesity, menopause and these neuropeptides
Significantly increased leptin and galanin levels in postmenopausal obese women coupled with decreased NPY levels revealed some changes in the neuropeptides regulating eating behavior, which may be the reason for the onset of postmenopausal obesity!
Oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) stimulate insulin and glucagon release from the pancreas, and evoke insulin secretion from the rat insulinoma cell line, RINm5F!
Leptin upregulates the expression of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) mRNA in islets of normal rats, but has no effect in islets of obese Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats with mutated leptin receptors!
We observed that primary microglial cultures and the THP-1 monocytic cell line are stimulated by fibrillar beta-amyloid and prion peptides to activate identical tyrosine kinase-dependent inflammatory signal transduction cascades!
As expected, in fusion of NPY alone (18 microg/day) augmented food intake (191.6% over the initial control, P < 0.05) and produced a 25.1% weight gain in conjunction with a 10-fold increase in serum leptin concentrations at the end of the 7-day period
Interestingly, coinfusion of this regimen of NPY with the highly effective anorectic and body reducing effects of CNTF (5.0 microg/day) not only prevented the CNTF-induced anorexia and weight loss, but also normalized serum leptin concentrations and hypothalamic NPY gene expression
These results demonstrate that chronic central infusion to produce a persistent elevation of the cytokine at pathophysiological levels (a situation that may normally manifest during infection, injury and inflammation) produced severe anorexia and weight loss in conjunction with reduction in both serum leptin concentrations and hypothalamic NPY gene expression!
Gamma-aminobutyric acid mediation of the inhibitory effect of nitric oxide on the arginine vasopressin and oxytocin responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia
Previous studies have demonstrated that the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME exerts positive effects on the arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, suggesting inhibitory actions of NO
AVP and OT secretory patterns during insulin (0.15 IU/kg, i.v.)-tolerance tests (ITT) were examined in seven normal male subjects with (experimental tests) and without (control test) concomitant treatment with L-NAME (40 micrograms/kg injected plus 50 micrograms/kg infused, i.v.), the GABAergic agent sodium valproate (600 mg in three divided doses orally) or the combination of L-NAME and sodium valproate
Insulin-induced hypoglycemia increased by 2-fold (peak vs. baseline) plasma AVP and OT levels
These data indicate a GABAergic mediation of the inhibitory modulation by NO of the AVP and OT responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia!
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hCG, hCG plus oxytocin and oxytocin on [3H] inositol phosphate (IP) formations in porcine myometrial cells obtained from ovariectomized and cyclic gilts
The highest production of total inositol phosphates (d.p.m.) was found in cells from ovariectomized gilts given in vivo estradiol benzoate and progesterone for five consecutive days and treated with 1000 mU hCG and 100 mU hCG plus 1 microM oxytocin (984 +/- 84 and 1063 +/- 131 vs 314 +/- 36, respectively)
There was also a very significant increase of IP1 after the addition of 1000 mU hCG (p < 0.001) and IP1 and IP3 when 1000 mU hCG plus oxytocin were added (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively)
Only oxytocin alone increased the formation of IPs in cells from ovariectomized pigs treated with estradiol in vivo (p < 0.01)
The highest dose of hCG plus The highest dose of hCG plus oxytocin provoked accumulation of total [3H]inositol phosphate (p < 0.05) 53% over the basal level on days 21/1 of the estrous cycle
The present study demonstrates that hCG and oxytocin can increase the accumulation of inositol phosphates in porcine myometrial cells!
Plasma insulin, cholecystokinin, galanin, neuropeptide Y and leptin levels in obese women with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus
Experimental studies provided evidences that leptin, cholecystokinin (CCK), galanin (GAL), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and insulin are involved in feeding behaviour
Plasma concentrations of FSH, leptin, CCK, GAL, NPY and insulin were determined using commercial RIA kits
Our results, ie higher mean plasma NPY levels in postmenopausal diabetic women and positive correlation of CCK with leptin and insulin, may suggest the role of these neuropeptides in metabolic disorders leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus!
We examined for the first time in young men effects of intravenous injections of NPY (4x50 or 100 microg, n = 9 and 11, respectively, at 22.00, 23.00, 24.00 and 01.00 compared to saline) on the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG; recorded from 23.00 to 07.00) and nocturnal secretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, growth hormone (GH), prolactin and leptin!
Amyloid beta protein disruption of cholinergic and growth factor phospholipase C signals could underlie cognitive and neurodegerative aspects of Alzheimer's disease!
These results suggest that T3 may increase UCP family expression independent of leptin action!
However, neither progesterone nor insulin increased phosphotyrosine on PLCgamma!
Sympathetic inhibition, leptin, and uncoupling protein subtype expression in normal fasting rats
To further investigate neural effects on leptin and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), we studied in vivo perturbations intended to block adrenergic input to peripheral tissues
We examined plasma leptin, leptin mRNA, and adipose and muscle UCP subtype mRNA in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT-ME), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis and 6-hydroxydopamine (6HDA), which is toxic to catecholinergic nerve terminals but, unlike AMPT-ME, does not enter the central nervous system
Intraperitoneal 6HDA, 100 mg/kg, as a single dose at 1800, increased plasma leptin approximately twofold after 18-20 h, increased IBAT (but not epididymal fat) leptin mRNA by two- to threefold, and decreased IBAT UCP-3 mRNA to 30-40% of control
However, the in vivo modulation of leptin and UCPs appears complex and, beyond a causal effect of SNA per se, may depend on concurrent changes in plasma insulin, glucose, and circulatory hemodynamics!
Oxytocin-treated male rats had increased circulating levels of cholecystokinin, a tendency to increased plasma levels of insulin (p = 0.066), and relatively more adipose tissue in the thigh and interscapular region, compared with controls!
PI-PLC treatment of fetal guinea pig brain cultures substantially reduced the amount of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the medium but had no effect on sAPPalpha
When this parental line was treated with PI-PLC, Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAPPbeta decreased to levels similar to those observed in the mutant line, and the mutant line was resistant to these effects of PI-PLC!
Vasopressin-induced activation of protein kinase C in renal epithelial cells
AVP induced a biphasic increase in diacylglycerol generation, characterized by an initial rapid rise and then a sustained elevation, and PKC activation, reflected by phosphorylation of a specific 80 kDa myristoylated alanine-rich PKC substrate (MARCKS)
These results argue that Ca(2+)-dependent PKC is involved in the action of AVP, and that of other agonists, which stimulate sodium transport!
Furthermore, our 14C-acetate-labeling studies showed a 50% reduction in cholesteryl ester synthesis in the presence of either flavonoid, which could account for the reduction in net apoB secretion caused by incubation with these compounds!
Granulosa cells were isolated from bovine preovulatory follicles and cultured for 3 days with or without OT in medium supplemented with either insulin (1 microgram/ml) + 1% fetal calf serum (FCS), which maintains basal estradiol secretion, or low doses of FSH (1 and 2 ng/ml) + 1% FCS, a culture condition that maximizes effects of FSH on estradiol secretion!
It has been established that amyloid beta peptide (AbetaP) activates phospholipase A2, phospholipase C and phospholipase D of LA-N-2 cells and other cell types
(-)Nicotine did not blunt the AbetaP activation of phospholipase C!
Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and phospholipase C (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion
However, leptin did constrain the enhanced PLC-mediated insulin secretion characteristic of islets from ob/ob mice, without influencing release from islets of lean mice
A specific enhancement in PLC-mediated insulin secretion is the earliest reported developmental alteration in insulin secretion from islets of ob/ob mice, and thus a logical target for leptin action
This action of leptin on PLC-mediated insulin secretion was dose-dependent, rapid-onset (i.e., within 3 min), and reversible
Leptin was equally effective in constraining the enhanced insulin release from islets of ob/ob mice caused by protein kinase C (PKC) activation, a downstream mediator of the PLC signal pathway
One function of leptin in control of body composition is thus to target a PKC-regulated component of the PLC-PKC signaling system within islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin!
Overexpression of G11alpha and isoforms of phospholipase C in islet  beta-cells reveals a lack of correlation between inositol phosphate  accumulation and insulin secretion.
It has been suggested that insulin secretion from pancreatic islets may be  mediated in part by activation of phospholipases C (PLCs) and  phosphoinositide hydrolysis.
The purpose of this study was to determine  whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated insulin secretion responses  of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or  activation of PLC isoforms.
Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PLC-delta1, -beta1, or  -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement  in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in insulin  secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite  the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell  extracts.
Overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets  elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on  insulin secretion.
Because the effect of carbachol on insulin secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PLC-beta1  or -beta3.
Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect  slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3, but  these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated insulin  secretion.!
SP ewes also had greater incorporation of [3H]inositol into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) (+3449%, p less than 0.01) and total inositol phosphate (IP) (+760%, p less than 0.08), in response to oxytocin, than did oCSP ewes (+553 and +168% for IP3 and total IP, respectively) in endometrium collected at ovariectomy/hysterectomy on Day 16
These results indicate that oTP-1 may prevent luteolysis by inhibiting development of endometrial responsiveness to oxytocin and, therefore, reduce oxytocin-induced synthesis of IP3 and PGF2 alpha!
The body mass index (BMI), leptin, plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY), serotonin, thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) in serum were evaluated for each subject!
Oxytocin-stimulated inositol phosphate turnover in endometrium of ewes is influenced by stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and intrauterine infusion of ovine conceptus secretory proteins
Three experiments (Exp) assessed the influence of stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and intrauterine infusion of ovine conceptus secretory proteins (oCSP) on turnover of inositol trisphosphate (the putative second-messenger for oxytocin-stimulated secretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha) in ovine endometrium during luteolysis and maternal recognition of pregnancy
For each Exp, 100 mg endometrium was incubated, in duplicate, for 2 h with 10 microCi [3H] inositol and treated with 0 or 100 nM oxytocin (OT) for 20 min, then [3H]inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (IP1, IP2, and IP3, respectively) were quantified!
These observations suggest that bradykinin, like oxytocin, activates phospholipase C which generates IP3 with a subsequent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores followed by store-operated Ca2+ influx!
Activation of EGFR overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes leads to a 3.4 +/- 1.2-fold stimulation of PLC activity over basal levels vs. only 1.06 +/- 0.01-fold stimulation by insulin.
Despite the low levels of insulin-induced PLC activity, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was similarly inhibited by U73122 (55.9 +/- 13.1% inhibition)
Inhibition of PLC activation did not impair either EGF- or insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase or incorporation of glucose into lipid, supporting the hypothesis that both EGF- and insulin-induced glucose disposal can be independent of GLUT4-mediated glucose transport.
The diminution of glucose transport secondary to inhibition of PLC activity was reflected by a decrease in GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane upon either EGF or insulin stimulation!
Analyses of hormone regulation of expression of mRNA for the aleurone RNase revealed that, like the pattern for alpha-amylase, mRNA levels increased in the presence of gibberellic acid, and its antagonist abscisic acid prevented this effect
Quantitative studies at early times demonstrated that cycloheximide treatment of aleurone layers increased mRNA levels 4-fold, whereas a combination of gibberellin plus cycloheximide treatment was required to increase alpha-amylase mRNA levels to the same extent!
The responses of serum oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) to the serotonergic HT1A agonist buspirone (15 mg p.o.) or the HTD1 agonist sumatriptan (6 mg injected subcutaneously) were evaluated in 7 normal men either in basal conditions or during an insulin (0.15 iu/kg as an i.v. bolus) tolerance test (ITT)
Stimulation of 5HT-1D receptors with sumatriptan was unable to change neither AVP nor OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia!
Thus, highly expressed in human adipocytes, the Y(1) receptor sustains the strong antilipolytic effect of NPY and exerts a positive action on leptin secretion!
To elucidate the pathophysiologic significance of UCP3 and UCP2 in the effect of TZDs on glucose metabolism and energy expenditure, we examined their basal mRNA levels in the WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle from Wistar fatty rats, a rat model of NIDDM and obesity with leptin receptor defect, and investigated expression of the genes encoding UCP3 and UCP2 in Wistar fatty rats and in Wistar lean rats with 2-week oral administration of 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) pioglitazone, a TZD derivative
These results clearly demonstrate that UCP3 gene expression is upregulated by TZDs in the WAT and BAT in Wistar fatty rats, an obese model with leptin receptor defect, and that adipose UCP3 gene expression is increased in response to TZDs in vitro!
PKB, which is an important early PI 3-kinase-dependent component of insulin signalling pathways, is also down-regulated by PLC-coupled agonists!
Once the abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform agent is initiated, any stress event ensuing in adult life induces a nerve growth factor-mediated synthesis of normal cellular prion protein isoform that aggregates to abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform, thereby becoming 'infected'/transformed into the same; due to the vicious circle of positive feedback invoked by the blocking of a prion protein-specific kinase!
Pretreatment of HEK-293 cells for 2 min with carbachol, a mAChR agonist, lysophosphatidic acid, or ATP, followed by agonist washout, strongly increased (by 2-3-fold) maximal PLC stimulation (measured >/=40 min later) by epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, but not insulin, and largely enhanced PLC sensitivity to these RTK agonists!
For example, leptin suppresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the arcuate nucleus!
Correlation between the stimulatory effect of oxytocin on the formation of inositol phosphates and the oxytocin receptor level in the pregnant rabbit myometrium
OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition
METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits
RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs)
On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs
Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition
When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation
In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the formation of IPs by OT, the OT receptor levels in the myometrium, and the production of PGF2 in the decidua might play crucial roles in parturition!
Phospholipase C (PLC) activity was investigated by stimulation of membrane preparations obtained from insulin (beta-TC3)-, somatostatin (Rin 1027-B2)-, and glucagon (INR1-G9)-producing pancreatic cell lines using the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPgammaS alone, the C-terminal octapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK-8), or gastrin!
Immunohistochemical localization of leptin and uncoupling protein in white and brown adipose tissue
To establish the cell type expressing leptin, we also assessed the size and organization of lipid droplets, the ultrastructural features of mitochondria, and the presence or absence of uncoupling protein, a brown fat-specific marker
In brown adipose tissue of lean animals, multilocular uncoupling protein (UCP)-positive brown adipocytes had typical brown mitochondria and were leptin-negative, both in fed and fasted conditions
At the periphery of the interscapular brown adipose tissue depot, unilocular, UCP-negative adipocytes (mean diameter: 41.55 microns) with white-type mitochondria were observed, and these cells were leptin-positive
In obese (db/db) animals, brown fat was composed mainly of small unilocular, UCP-positive adipocytes (mean diameter: 40.08 microns), which were also leptin-positive
In summary, classical brown adipocytes differ from white adipocytes, not only by their morphology and UCP expression, but also by their apparent lack of detectable leptin expression!
Leptin increases uncoupling protein expression and energy expenditure
Leptin increased BAT UCP mRNA levels greater than twofold in both ad libitum-fed and food-restricted rats
These data demonstrate a leptin-induced increase in energy expenditure in nonmutant rodents and suggest that one mechanism by which leptin increases energy expenditure is through increased thermogenesis in BAT, including increased expression of UCP!
Enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis via overexpression of phospholipase C beta1 or delta1 inhibits stimulus-induced insulin release in insulinoma MIN6 cells.
To study the effects of enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis on insulin secretion, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cbeta1 (PLCbeta1) or PLCdelta1 was overexpressed in insulinoma MIN6 cells via adenoviral vectors.!
The bovine ovarian granulosa cell model is a primary culture system where under stimulation by insulin or IGF-I and LH the endogenous oxytocin gene is massively upregulated!
Amyloid beta protein (25-35) stimulation of phospholipase C in LA-N-2 cells
This phospholipase C stimulation by amyloid beta protein appeared to be pertussis toxin sensitive
It is possible that this phospholipase C stimulation by amyloid beta protein is a receptor-mediated process
Amyloid beta protein stimulation of phospholipase C was absent from LA-N-2 cells previously treated with norepinephrine, trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD), bombesin, or amyloid beta peptide
It is suggested that this observed amyloid beta protein stimulation of phospholipase C may be responsible for the elevated quantity of inositol seen in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients!
The specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine (5 micrometers) inhibited PTH-, AVP-, PGE2-, and adenosine-stimulated Ca2+ reabsorption by 77%, 67%, 79%, and 100%, respectively
CONCLUSION: PTH, AVP, PGE2, and adenosine stimulate Ca2+ reabsorption via a pathway that is independent of cAMP and that involves a phorbol ester-insensitive PKC isotype!
In addition, abscisic acid-mediated inhibition of gibberellin-stimulated responses seems to depend on the activation of a phospholipase D during induction of alpha-amylase in barley aleurone cells as well as on a putative acetyltransferase involved in elongation growth.!
Regulation of insulin secretion via ATP-sensitive K+ channel independent mechanisms: role of phospholipase C
The further addition of carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of phospholipase C distinct from that activated by glucose, together with K+, 20 mM glucose, plus diazoxide resulted in a sustained amplification of insulin secretion from mouse but not rat islets
The inability to activate a nutrient- and calcium-regulated phospholipase C isozyme in mouse islets to the same extent as in rat islets appears to account, at least in part, for these different insulin secretory responses under these unique conditions!
DNase1 footprints suggest the involvement of at least three types of transcription factors in the regulation of alpha-Amy2/A by gibberellin
The regulation of alpha-Amy2 genes by GA therefore involves an interplay of at least three different types of transcription factor!
A caveolin-1-dependent coupling of PrPc to the tyrosine kinase Fyn was observed!
Vasopressin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation by activation of PKC in the rat smooth muscle cell line, A-10
The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors: staurosporine, H7 and GF109203X are able to block the AVP-stimulated phosphorylation
These results indicate that PKC is upstream of the phosphorylation, a motion which is supported by the fact that the AVP-stimulated phosphorylation was downregulated by phorbol esters!
Chronic central leptin infusion enhances insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism and favors the expression of uncoupling proteins
In marked contrast, intracerebroventricular leptin administration was accompanied by the maintenance of high UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 expression in all these tissues
While leptin maintains or favors energy-dissipating mechanisms (UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3), the latter are markedly depressed in pair-fed rats!
The etiology for diabetes mellitus in PWS may be related to the morbid obesity and consequent insulin resistance, because a decrease of oxytocin neurons and leptin resistance in PWS may cause hyperphagia, inducing obesity!
Furthermore, treatment of isolated rat diaphragms and adipocytes with PIG-P as well as with other agents exerting partially insulin-mimetic activity, such as PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and the sulfonylurea glimepiride, triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of the caveolar marker protein caveolin, which was apparently correlated with stimulation of lipogenesis
Strikingly, in adipocytes subjected to combined trypsin/salt treatment, PIG-P, PI-specific PLC, and glimepiride failed completely to provoke insulin-mimetic effects!
Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y and its neuroendocrine regulation by leptin!
Leptin Rapidly Inhibits Hypothalamic Neuropeptide Y Secretion and Stimulates Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Secretion in Adrenalectomized Mice
Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake
We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration
No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice
The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion
Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51%
The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone!
Insulin-like signaling in yeast: modulation of protein phosphatase 2A, protein kinase A, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activities
In addition, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by insulin, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus insulin in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the GPI-PLC
GPI-PLC was most pronouncedly stimulated by authentic human insulin compared to various insulin analogues and insulin-like growth factor I
As the GPI-PLC reaction is rate limiting, the efficiency of the two-step anchor cleavage was significantly increased when insulin was present together with glucose as compared to glucose alone
The insulin concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation
The data suggest that mammalian insulin-sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC) involved in the transduction of the insulin signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase!
Oxytocin central injections to intact animals stimulated insulin synthesis and secretion without changing of islets area
Thus, oxytocin administration stimulates insulin synthesis and secretion in intact and diabetic animals and this effect is more expressed with central injections!
Compared with the wild type, GA induction of alpha-amylase activity in aleurone cells of d1 was greatly reduced
Relative to the wild type, the GA(3)-treated aleurone layer of d1 had lower expression of Ramy1A, which encodes alpha-amylase, and OsGAMYB, which encodes a GA-inducible transcriptional factor, and no increase in expression of Ca(2 +)-ATPase
However, in the presence of high GA concentrations, alpha-amylase induction occurred even in d1
All these results suggest that d1 affects a part of the GA-signaling pathway, namely the induction of alpha-amylase in the aleurone layer and internode elongation!
Therefore, it was examined whether stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin causes changes in the subcellular distribution of EGF receptors and phospholipase Cgamma1 that could potentially explain the observed synergy or costimulation.
However, both EGF and insulin stimulated the accumulation of phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc, which was coincident with the EGF receptor in the case of insulin- stimulated cells.
Therefore, it is suggested that the insulin-induced coclustering of the EGF receptor with phospholipase Cgamma1 at the actin arc may allow for greater efficiency of signal transduction, resulting in the synergy observed for these two hormones in stimulation of DNA synthesis.!
These findings support the concept that the mitochondrial metabolism of nutrient molecules is an event sufficient to acutely augment insulin release from the beta cell, to increase phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and to induce time-dependent potentiation of insulin secretion!
Fasting and leptin modulate adipose and muscle uncoupling protein: divergent effects between messenger ribonucleic acid and protein expression
In this study, we examined the effects of fasting for 2 days and exogenous s.c. leptin, 200 microg every 8 h for 2 days, on the regulation of uncoupling protein (UCP) subtypes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gastrocnemius muscle
Leptin, compared with vehicle, did not alter BAT UCP-1 or UCP-3 mRNA or protein expression when administered to normal ad libitum fed rats
Fasting significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 and UCP-3 mRNA expression, to 31% and 30% of ad libitum fed controls, respectively, effects which were prevented by administration of leptin to fasted rats
Fasting also significantly decreased BAT UCP-1 protein expression, to 67% of control; however, that effect was not prevented by leptin treatment
Fasting, with or without leptin administration, did not affect BAT UCP-2 mRNA; however, leptin administration to ad libitum fed rats significantly increased BAT UCP-2 mRNA, to 138% of control
Fasting significantly enhanced gastrocnemius muscle UCP-3 mRNA (411% of control) and protein expression (168% of control), whereas leptin administration to fasted rats did not alter either of these effects
In summary, UCP subtype mRNA and protein are regulated in tissue- and subtype-specific fashion by leptin and food restriction!
Although the above data are consistent with a direct ability of leptin to promote TRH biosynthesis through actions on TRH neurons, addition of a-MSH produced a 3.5 fold increase in TRH biosynthesis and release, whereas NPY treatment suppressed ~3 fold proTRH biosynthesis!
The influence of myrigalone B, a flavonoid from the fruit exudate of Myrica gale L. on Cu(2+)-induced oxidation of low density lipoprotein from cholesterol fed rabbits was investigated!
Molecular characterization of catalytic-subunit cDNA sequences encoding protein phosphatases 1 and 2A and study of their roles in the gibberellin-dependent Osamy-c expression in rice
To understand the molecular mechanism of gibberellin-dependent gene regulation, the effect of three phosphatase inhibitors on the germination of rice seeds and the expression of a target gene, the alpha-amylase gene, Osamy-c, were measured
To further understand the possible role of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in the GA-dependent expression of Osamy-c, we isolated cDNA clones encoding protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A from a rice aleurone cDNA library
Taken together, our results suggest that protein phosphatases PP1 or PP2A are involved in the GA-dependent expression of the rice Osamy-c gene, though the PP1 or/and PP2A enzymatic activities as well as mRNA levels do not increase upon GA3 treatment!
Signal transduction in pancreatic beta-cells: Regulation of insulin secretion by information flow in the phospholipase C/Protein kinase C pathway
The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system
When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion
Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose
When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release!
Further investigation suggested that activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which is part of the AVP-induced intracellular signalling pathway, is necessary and sufficient for the generation of the synergistic response, although it is not obligatory for AVP-induced ACTH release!
Homogeneous liposome immunoassay for insulin using phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens
Insulin was conjugated to phospholipase C by a three-step procedure with hetero-bifunctional crosslinking reagents, succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate and 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester
Both p-nitrophenylphosphatidylcholine hydrolytic activity and liposome lytic activity of insulin-phospholipase C conjugate were inhibited in the presence of insulin antiserum!
If daily oxytocin injections are repeated over a 5-day period, blood pressure is decreased by 10-20 mmHg, the withdrawal latency to heat stimuli is prolonged, cortisol levels are decreased and insulin and cholecystokinin levels are increased!
Cellular preincubation with 200 microg/ml antibodies against the inositolphosphoglycan (IPG) moiety of the GPI-anchor (Ab(IPG)), or depletion in GPI-anchored proteins by cellular pretreatment with 0.5 U/ml PI-PLC, 1 mM insulin and 2 HU/ml streptolysin-O, or depletion in membrane cholesterol content by filipin (5 microg/ml), digitonin (5 microg/ml) and cholesterol oxidase (0.5 U/ml) decreases the HDL3-signal, suggesting the involvement of a lipolytic cleavage of GPI-anchored proteins!
Oxytocin (OT) is more expressed in the TEC/TNC than vasopressin (VP); insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) thymic expression predominates over IGF-1, and much more over (pro)insulin
Thus, OT was proposed to be the self antigen of the neurohypophysial family, and IGF-2 the self antigen precursor of the insulin family!
Furthermore, in SN-56/OBR cells both CNTF and leptin produce changes in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide phenotype characteristic of cholinergic neurons, such as an increase in choline acetyltransferase and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and a decrease in neuropeptide Y expression!
Arcuate nucleus NPY mRNA increased in rats given protein-free diet, correlating with leptin rather than decreased feeding!
These results suggest that, in isolated white adipocytes, the released adenosine acts as a helper and/or a positive regulator for insulin in the release of leptin via an activation of adenosine A1 receptors that involves the PLC-PKC pathway.!
Inhibition of 5-HT3 serotonergic receptors with ondansetron (4 or 8 mg) did not modify the basal secretion of AVP and OT and the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia!
The effects of the fluorinated analogues were evaluated on inhibition of cress seed germination and inhibition of gibberellin-inducible alpha-amylase induction in embryoless barley half-seeds
(2E, 4E)-2-Fluoro-5-(1'-hydroxy-2',6', 6'-trimethyl-2'-cyclohexen-1'-yl)-3-methyl-2,4-pentadienoic acid (5b) showed potent inhibitory activity at the same level as ABA in the cress seed germination test, and 5b also inhibited gibberellin-inducible alpha-amylase induction at 4 x 10(-)(6), 3 times the concentration of ABA (1 x 10(-)(6)) for 50% inhibition of alpha-amylase production!
Although osmotic stimuli cause an increase in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity as well as synthesis of AVP and oxytocin in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON), it is not known whether NOS activity in the hypothalamus changes in the diabetic patients who have plasma hyperosmolality with hyperglycaemia caused by insulin deficiency
Three weeks after administration of STZ, the diabetic rats were subcutaneously treated with insulin for 1 week, which resulted in significant suppression of the induction of nNOS, AVP and oxytocin gene expression in the PVN and SON!
OT evokes the release of Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive intracellular stores!
Arginine vasopressin (AVP) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) have been shown to stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells
However, AVP-induced activation of RSK2, a downstream substrate of ERK1 and ERK2, was PKC-dependent and PI 3-kinase-independent
PKC was necessary in AVP- but not in LPA-induced activation of p70 S6K!
Similarly, central leptin treatment also had a greater effect in suppressing hypothalamic NPY mRNA expression in young (-23+/-4%) than in old (-8+/-4%) rats compared with their age-matched pair-fed treated rats!
Ten protein kinases have been assayed for their ability to phosphorylate in vitro the recombinant bovine PrP (25-242) (rbPrP)
With regard to CK2, phosphorylation occurs at Ser 154 with a stoichiometry of about 0.1 mol phosphate/mol rbPrP, which is doubled by mild heat treatment of rbPrP!
Both receive information about the nutritional status and the level of energy storage through insulin and leptin signaling mediated by specific receptors located on POMC and NPY neurons present predominantly in the arcuate nucleus (ARC).
When leptin signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the NPY system is upregulated as shown by mRNA overexpression and increased peptide release, whereas the content and/or release of some inhibitory peptides (neurotensin, cholecystokinin) are diminished.!
Current interest in reducing heart disease risks by diet involves attention to total fat; saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and trans fatty acids, as well as dietary cholesterol, soluble fiber, salt, alcohol, antioxidants, dietary alterations causing homocysteinemia and other dietary constituents, such as flavonoid compounds in some soy products!
Gibbestatin B inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase expression in cereal seeds [In Process Citation]
The expression of alpha-amylase in aleurone layers of barley is known to be induced by gibberellin A3 (GA).
In the present study, gibbestatin B (GNB) was isolated from Streptomyces sp. C-39 as an inhibitor of the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase in barley and rice, with IC50 values of 125 and 70 microM, respectively.
GNB suppressed accumulation of GA-induced barley high-pI type B and rice RAmylA alpha-amylase transcripts.
These analyses indicate that GNB inhibits the GA-induced expression of alpha-amylase by regulating one of the steps involved in ABA signaling, but not by acting as a weak ABA analog.!
Leptin is a satiety factor which acts within the hypothalamus to decrease the levels of several neuropeptides stimulating food intake (among them, neuropeptide Y [NPY]), while increasing those that inhibit food intake!
The results demonstrate that potent antioxidants, such as flavonoids, protect MM-LDL from lipoperoxidation and preserve their ability to efficiently deliver cholesterol to cells!
This indicates that the calcium response to OT application was principally associated with activation of the IP3-sensitive calcium stores!
A loop system exists between hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peripheral adipose tissue leptin to maintain normal body homeostasis
When infused i.c.v. to normal rats to mimic its central effects, leptin decreases NPY levels, thus food intake and body weight
Circadian fluctuations of NPY and leptin levels maintain normal body homeostasis
Leptin increases the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCP-1, -2, -3) and thus energy dissipation!
Relationship among leptin, neuropeptide Y, and galanin in young women and in postmenopausal women [see comments]
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormonal status may affect neuropeptide Y (NPY), galanin, and leptin release in postmenopausal women and in young women
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the differences is plasma leptin, NPY, and galanin between postmenopausal women and young women may be related to body mass index rather than to differences in hormonal status and that the higher NPY levels in both lean and obese postmenopausal women than in young women indicate that factors other than body mass index may be involved!
However, the AVP-dependent stimulation required activation of protein kinase C (PKC), whereas the inhibition was PKC independent, indicating that the NGF-induced signaling pathways leading to inhibition and stimulation of HCO3- absorption are distinct!
The activity of catalase was found to be significantly enhanced in the tissues of normal and cholesterol fed rats administered 1 mg flavonoid from brinjal/100 g BW/day!
These findings are consistent with increased leptin signaling to the NPY and POMC neurons in the ARC by physiological levels of circulating leptin during normal feeding!
NPY-leptin: opposing effects on appetitive and consummatory ingestive behavior and sexual behavior
Many studies have indicated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates and leptin inhibits food intake
In line with this, intracerebroventricular injection of NPY (10 microg) stimulated and leptin (10 microg) inhibited intake of a sucrose solution when female rats were required to obtain the solution from a bottle
However, NPY inhibited and leptin stimulated intake if the solution was infused intraorally
Thus NPY stimulates the responses used to obtain food but inhibits those used to consume food, and leptin has the opposite effects!
Secreted form of beta-amyloid precursor protein activates protein kinase C and phospholipase Cgamma1 in cultured embryonic rat neocortical cells
Furthermore, we demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma1 and formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were increased by sAPP695-stimulation!
By comparison with the promoters of alpha-amylase genes, which are also induced by GA, we suggest that GARE is coupled with the upstream element and the pyrimidine box to form a GA response complex!
In HVSMC both oxytocin and AVP increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production and [Ca2+]i response, but the efficacy of the responses was greater for oxytocin than AVP!
Carbachol and oxytocin stimulate the generation of inositol phosphates in the guinea pig myometrium
In the guinea pig myometrium prelabelled with myo-[2-3H]inositol, carbachol and oxytocin enhanced a concentration-dependent and rapid release of IP3 which preceded that of IP2 and IP1!
A barley gene encoding a novel DNA-binding protein (HRT) was identified by southwestern screening with baits containing a gibberellin phytohormone response element from an alpha-amylase promoter!
This effect is maximal at 10(-8) M AVP (a concentration clearly above the normal physiological range of AVP concentrations) and involves the V2 receptor pathway, while activation of protein kinase C or changes in intracellular calcium are ineffective!
Plasma oxytocin, and some functionally related peptides (CCK, gastrin, somatostatin and insulin), were measured by standard radioimmunoassay techniques!
Neural site of leptin influence on neuropeptide Y signaling pathways altering feeding and uncoupling protein
NPY in the PVN increases feeding and decreases uncoupling protein (UCP) activity in brown fat, whereas leptin decreases NPY biosynthesis in the Arc, which presumably decreases PVN NPY
Next, we determined that leptin decreases NPY and increases UCP gene expression!
During luteinization of bovine granulosa cells in vitro in the presence of insulin, or insulin plus forskolin, there is a massive upregulation not only of progesterone production, but also of the gene for the peptide hormone oxytocin, with secretion of the peptide into the medium!
In the present study we found that at increasing GA concentrations, increasing numbers of barley (Hordeum vulgare) cells showed the enhanced amylase secretion and vacuolation characteristic of the GA response!
Phosphoinositide hydrolysis, resulting in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DG) formation, has been implicated in oxytocin-stimulated pulsatile secretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) from uterine endometrium of sheep and other mammals!
Phorbol myristate acetate (TPA), an activator of PKC, elicited an increase of MAPK activity, but did not further influence the level of AVP4-8-enhanced MAPK activity; Nevertheless, the extent of CaMKII activation was attenuated by TPA!
These data suggest that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation at a step involving GTP-binding protein/PLC coupling can exert a negative effect on the stimulation of IP3 formation by oxytocin and thereby affect contraction/relaxation in the myometrium!
The aims of this study were: (1) to assess the effects of maternal undernutrition during pregnancy on adult offspring with regard to growth, body composition and plasma levels of glucose, insulin and corticosterone, and (2) to investigate whether oxytocin treatment early in life could ameliorate the adverse effects of food restriction in utero!
The SGR and RGR also had different endocrine profiles with, for example, twice as high oxytocin (p < 0.01) and insulin levels (p < 0.01) in RGR compared to the SGR!
C75 inhibited expression of the prophagic signal neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus and acted in a leptin-independent manner that appears to be mediated by malonyl-coenzyme A!
The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1), oxytocin, prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) on 45Ca2+ mobilization in permeabilized rat myometrial cells and to examine the activation of the inositol lipid cycle in intact myocytes
All four agonists caused a biphasic release of 45Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial pool(s), with the rank order of potency: oxytocin > PGF2 alpha > ET-1 > IP3
Endothelin-1 and oxytocin stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation at concentrations similar to those that promoted 45Ca2+ efflux, whereas about 100 times higher concentrations of PGF2 alpha were needed to activate this signaling pathway in intact cells
It is concluded that the primary action of PGF2 alpha in myometrial cells is to enhance Ca2+ influx, whereas oxytocin and ET-1 receptors are coupled to phospholipase C, generating IP3 and raising the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ from intracellular as well as extracellular sources!
Ca2+ signalling in rat vascular smooth muscle cells: a role for protein kinase C at physiological vasoconstrictor concentrations of vasopressin
The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM)
The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP
Time-dependent redistribution of PKC-alpha, -delta and -epsilon isoforms between the membrane and cytosolic fractions occurred in response to 100 pM AVP
Pretreatment for 24 h with 1 microM PMA downregulated expression of PKC-alpha and -delta, but not PKC-epsilon, and prevented the Ca2+-spiking responses to either 1 nM PMA or 100 pM AVP
We conclude that PKC activation is a necessary step in the signal transduction pathway linking low concentrations of AVP to Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells!
Bovine prion protein as a modulator of protein kinase CK2
On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2')
We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2
A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity
These results disclose the potential of the PrP to modulate the activity of CK2, a pleiotropic protein kinase that is particularly abundant in the brain!
To assess the possible involvement of PKC in AVP and IL-1 action in Leydig cells, the PKC inhibitor Calphostin C was tested
These results confirm that AVP and PMA activate PKC and indicate that IL-1 likely does not activate PKC in Leydig cells!
Tolbutamide and diazoxide modulate phospholipase C-linked Ca(2+) signaling and insulin secretion in beta-cells
We examined whether tolbutamide and diazoxide, which close or open ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP) channels), respectively, interact with PLC-linked Ca(2+) signals in HIT-T15 and mouse beta-cells and with PLC-linked insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells
Thus tolbutamide and diazoxide regulate both PLC-linked Ca(2+) signaling and insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by modulating K(ATP) channels, thereby determining voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) influx!
Leptin effects on pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion from the adult rat hypothalamus and interaction with cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript peptide and neuropeptide Y [In Process Citation]
Leptin may act as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamic control of appetite through suppression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART).
We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system.
The increase in GnRH pulse amplitude caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y5-receptor antagonist (10(-7) M).
In conclusion, leptin and NPY show separate permissive effects on GnRH secretion in the adult rat hypothalamus.!
Neurotransmitters and hormones, such as arginine vasopressin (AVP) and bombesin, evoke frequency-modulated repetitive Ca2+ transients in insulin-secreting HIT-T15 cells by binding to receptors linked to phospholipase C (PLC)!
Melatonin inhibits oxytocin response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, but not to angiotensin II in normal men
In order to establish whether melatonin alters basal and/or stimulated oxytocin secretion, 18 normal men were treated (p.o.) with 6 or 12 mg melatonin or placebo in basal conditions (N-6 subjects) or concomitantly to the administration of insulin (O.15 IU/kg body weight in an i.v. bolus) (N-6 subjects) or angiotensin II (increasing doses of 4, 8 and 16 ng/kg/min, at intervals of 20 min)
In contrast, the oxytocin response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was significantly reduced by melatonin treatment!
In vivo effects of CGP-12177 on the expression of leptin and uncoupling protein genes in mouse brown and white adipose tissues
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chronic treatment with CGP-12177 a beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist with beta2/beta1-AR antagonist action, on the expression of the leptin gene and of genes coding for uncoupling proteins (ucp1, ucp2 and ucp3) in brown and white adipose tissues
CONCLUSION: The results reveal that simultaneous stimulation of the expression of certain ucp genes and the leptin gene can be achieved, and suggest that adrenergic regulation of the leptin gene and of genes of the ucp family in adipose tissues is the result of complex interactions between the different beta-AR pathways!
The induction of alpha-amylase triggered by gibberellic acid in barley embryos is repressed by sugars
Our results indicate that glucose represses gibberellin signalling late along this hormone transduction pathway, downstream of transcription of the gibberellin-modulated transcriptional activator (GAMYB) needed for alpha-amylase induction!
Isolation and characterization of gibbestatin B, an inhibitor of gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase, and gibbestatin C from streptomycetaes!
HvSPY coexpression largely abolished GA3-induced activity of an alpha-amylase promoter.!
2) IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin also induced a Ca2+ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum: phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors, neomycin, or U-73122 partially blocked the intracellular [Ca2+]i increase induced by IGF-1 and insulin and totally inhibited the effect of IGF-2!
The two groups were similar in their morning thyroxin, triiodothyronine, TSH, estradiol, cortisol, gastrin, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, oxytocin, insulin and IGF-1 levels!
Further, the oxytocin-induced activation of IK(sl) was effectively antagonized by 5 x 10(-8) mol/l U-73122 or 5 x 10(-6) mol/l 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate (inhibitors of the cell membrane phospholipase C), as well as by intracellularly applied heparin (selective inhibitor of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release channels)
The data obtained suggest (i) that selective oxytocin receptors are present on the membranes of guinea-pig antral smooth muscle cells, (ii) that the oxytocin-related relaxation may result from the activation of Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ conductivity via activation of IP3-induced release of Ca2+ from the submembrane located cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores and (iii) in turn, this evokes a non-inactivating component of IK, hyperpolarizing the cell membrane!
The distribution of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) cells in the SCN overlapped with that of PKC in both species
Species differences in the location of the Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms suggest differences in function such as the relaying of photic or non-photic information to the clock mechanism, or the synchronization of AVP neurons and their subsequent output signals!
Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors reversed AVP inhibition, whereas PKC activator inhibited nitrite production
The inhibitory action of AVP involves both the activation of PKC and the transcription of iNOS mRNA in cultured rat GMC!
Induction by leptin of uncoupling protein-2 and enzymes of fatty acid oxidation
Here we show that leptin alters in pancreatic islets the mRNA of the genes encoding enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2)
Leptin overexpression increased UCP-2 mRNA by more than 10-fold in epididymal, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous fat tissue of normal, but not of leptin-receptor-defective obese rats
By directly regulating the expression of enzymes of free fatty acid metabolism and of UCP-2, leptin controls intracellular triglyceride content of certain nonadipocytes, as well as adipocytes!
In isolated adipocytes, the loss of almost half the 18S RNA content over a 24-hour incubation was prevented in the presence of insulin but not oxytocin or epidermal growth factor (EGF)!
Long-term changes in gastrin, cholecystokinin and insulin in response to oxytocin treatment
The present study was designed to investigate how repeated injections of oxytocin influence plasma levels of vagally controlled hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin and somatostatin, as well as of endogenous oxytocin and glucose
In addition, both insulin and CCK levels were decreased in response to the oxytocin treatment when measured 3 and 10 days after the last injection (ANOVA; insulin p < 0.01, CCK p < 0.05)
When the alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (2.5 microgram/kg intracerebroventricularly) was administered 3 days after the 5-day treatment period with oxytocin or saline, plasma levels of insulin and CCK increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the oxytocin-treated rats, when compared to saline-treated controls receiving clonidine only
In conclusion, these results show that oxytocin induces long-lasting changes in plasma levels of gastrin, CCK and insulin, without affecting somatostatin or glucose levels!
Dietary intakes of flavonols, flavones and isoflavones by Japanese women and the inverse correlation between quercetin intake and plasma LDL cholesterol concentration
The total intake of flavonoids was inversely correlated with the plasma total cholesterol concentration (TC) (r = -0.236, P: < 0.05) and plasma LDL cholesterol concentration (LDL-C) (r = -0.220, P: < 0.05), after the adjustment for age, body mass index and total energy intake!
OT may rapidly stimulate inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) formation, consistent with the concept of rapid activation of a second-messenger system
In support of this hypothesis, endometrial IP3 levels were increased (P < 0.05) within 0.5 min after treatment with 0.1 microM OT
These results indicate that OT induces endometrial IP3 production in a rapid manner indicative of a second-messenger system!
We have established that the recovery of secreted N1 is increased by the protein kinase C agonists PDBu and PMA in a time- and dose-dependent manner in both cell lines
In contrast, secretion of N1 remains unaffected by the inactive PDBu analog alphaPDD and by the protein kinase A effectors dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin
Overall, our data indicate that the normal processing of PrP(c) is up-regulated by protein kinase C but not protein kinase A in human cells and murine neurons!
Wortmannin converts insulin but not oxytocin from an antilipolytic to a lipolytic agent in the presence of forskolin
The present studies compared the effects of insulin in rat adipocytes with the effects of oxytocin and peroxovanadate, which mimic some effects of insulin
The antilipolytic effects of peroxovanadate and oxytocin were unaffected by 500 nmol/L wortmannin, which blocked the antilipolytic action of insulin
The data provide additional support for the hypothesis that oxytocin and peroxovanadate affect adipose tissue metabolism by mechanisms distinctly different from those involved in insulin action!
8-OH-DPAT also increased insulin and decreased CCK and somatostatin levels, effects that were blocked by pretreatment with the oxytocin antagonist
Taken together, these data suggest that the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on plasma levels of insulin, somatostatin and CCK may be mediated by oxytocin
In previous experiments, we have shown that following i.c.v. application of oxytocin, plasma levels of insulin are increased through a cholinergic mechanism!
We previously reported that adiposity and serum leptin levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum leptin are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats
These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic NPY mRNA by leptin may be impaired with age
We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus
Leptin infusion diminished hypothalamic NPY levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in senescent rats
These diminished responses to leptin were associated with and may be the result of an impaired suppression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels!
Oxytocin induced a biphasic increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration of porcine myometrial cells: participation of a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ pool, and Ca2+ channels
Administration of OT (1 microM) for 15 sec increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation by 61%
Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX, 1 microgram/ml) for 2 hr failed to alter the OT-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and IP3 formation
U-73122 (3 microM) also abolished the OT-induced IP3 formation!
The gibberellin-responsive elements conserved in cereal alpha-amylase genes are not included in the 5'-upstream region of Rep1 or RepA!
We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion
Endometrial IP3 was increased within 30 seconds after OT treatment and preceded the increase in PGF2 alpha release stimulated by OT
These results support the hypothesis that OT stimulates phospholipase C to hydrolyze PI, yielding IP3 and DAG second-messengers which promote endometrial PGF2 alpha release during CL regression in pigs!
Interactions between leptin and NPY affecting lipid mobilization in adipose tissue
The aim of the current investigations was focused on the study of the involvement of leptin and neuropeptide Y in lipid mobilization
The lipolytic rate was assessed through glycerol release after incubation with leptin and NPY at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-12) M in isolated adipocytes obtained from female rats
At equimolar concentrations of leptin and NPY (10(-12) to 10(-6) M) the observed lipolytic activity is comparable to the basal lipolytic activity, except at a concentration of 10(-9) M where upon a significant increase in lipolysis is observed
Summing up, new evidence suggests that NPY and leptin may interact in a homeostatic loop to regulate body-fat mass and energy balance not only at the central nervous system level, but also directly at the adipocyte level!
Furthermore, immunocytochemical studies showed the A beta-induced neuronal MAC expression on the SH-SY5Y cells after CD59 was removed by PIPLC or blocked by anti-CD59 antibody!
Uncoupling protein-3 is a mediator of thermogenesis regulated by thyroid hormone, beta3-adrenergic agonists, and leptin
UCP3 mRNA levels were also regulated by dexamethasone, leptin, and starvation, albeit differently in muscle and brown adipose tissue!
The second class of mutant, gse (GA sensitivity), differed principally in GA sensitivity, requiring approximately 100-fold higher [GA3] for both leaf elongation and alpha-amylase production by aleurone!
Oxytocin stimulates IP3 production in dose-dependent fashion as well!
This action of beta-amyloid 25-35 is not altered by pretreatment with the calcium channel blockers nifedipine or cobalt, with the depleter of intracellular calcium stores cyclopiazonic acid, or with the phospholipase C inhibitor neomycin!
Hesperidin, the most important flavanone of Citrus sp., significantly increases HDL and lowers cholesterol, LDL, total lipid and triglyceride plasma levels in normolipidemic rats and in rats with diet- and triton-induced hyperlipidemia!
Effect of residual endogenous insulin secretion on the abnormal oxytocin response to hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetics
Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous insulin secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates OT secretion
DESIGN: Case-control study: the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous insulin secretion
Blood samples for OT assay were taken just before the rapid injection of insulin (time 0) and at time 15, 30, 45 and 60 min
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a residual endogenous insulin secretion exerts a partial protective action against the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder affecting the OT secretory system in IDDM!
After protein kinase C activity was functionally depleted by treating cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 hours, AVP did not augment IL-1beta-induced NO production
The effect of AVP was also inhibited in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C
The addition of AVP increased protein kinase C activity in cardiac myocytes, and its effect was significantly inhibited in the presence of calphostin C
These results support the hypothesis that the heart may be a target organ for AVP and that AVP modulates IL-1beta-induced iNOS expression in myocytes through the V1a receptor, which is mediated at least partially via activation of protein kinase C!
Signal transduction of arginine vasopressin-induced arachidonic acid release in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts: role of Ca2+ and the protein kinase C-dependent activation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase
The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 or ionomycin, mimicked the effect of AVP, whereas the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, TPA, only induced a slight increase in AA release
Western blots demonstrated expression of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, delta, and zeta in H9c2 cells; PKC inhibitors (staurosporine or Ro 31-8220) or down-regulation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta by long-term (24 h) TPA treatment caused a partial blockade of the AVP-induced response, whereas the A23187-induced AA release was unaffected by down-regulation of these isoforms
AVP- or TPA-induced activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK were completely blocked by down-regulation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta, but still occurred, together with the cytosolic PLA2 mobility shift, in the absence of external Ca2+
These results show that AVP-induced AA release in H9c2 cells is secondary to activation of the V1 receptor/Gq protein/PLCP pathway, leading to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and activation of PKCalpha, betaI, epsilon, and delta!
We also determined whether well known hypothalamic neuropeptide targets, e.g. neuropeptide Y (NPY), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti-related peptide (AGRP) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) were regulated in a pattern consistent with their presumed roles as mediators of leptin action
In contrast, leptin decreased body weight and adiposity, increased CART and suppressed NPY and AGRP mRNA expression in adult mice!
In the fasting state UCP-2 expression correlated inversely with body mass index (r = -0.45; P = 0.026), percent body fat (r = -0.41; P = 0.05), plasma insulin (r = -0.47; P = 0.02), epigastric venous fatty acids (r = -0.45; P = 0.04), and leptin (r = -0.50; P = 0.018)
UCP-2 expression remained inversely related with plasma leptin after controlling for percent body (r = -0.45; P = 0.038)
In conclusion, 1) UCP-2 messenger ribonucleic acid expression in sc adipose tissue is inversely related to adiposity and independently linked to local plasma leptin levels; and 2) UCP-2 expression is not acutely regulated by food intake, insulin, or fatty acids!
The activity of the MAPKs, induced by AVP or PMA was inhibited by downregulation of protein kinase C (PKC), by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059
We suggest that AVP activates the 42/44kDa MAPKs through a signal transduction pathway that involves stimulation of AVP-V1 receptor, tyrosine kinase, PKC and MEK!
Our data demonstrate, that activation of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase alone is sufficient to promote APP secretion, whereas inhibition of MAP kinase will reduce APP secretion only when phospholipase Cgamma or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are additionally inhibited!
Association of the insulin receptor with phospholipase C-gamma (PLCgamma) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes suggests a role for PLCgamma in metabolic signaling by insulin
To determine the functional significance of the interaction of PLCgamma and the IR, we used a specific inhibitor of PLC, U73122, or microinjection of SH2 domain glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins derived from PLCgamma to block insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation!
Effects of intravenously infused leptin on insulin sensitivity and on the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue
Centrally administered leptin has been shown to increase insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and to favor the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs)
To study if leptin also has direct peripherally mediated effects on these processes, this hormone (1 mg/day) or its vehicle was infused i.v. for 4 days to lean rats and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as the expression of UCP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in brown adipose tissue were measured
I.v. leptin infusion also favored the expression of UCPs in brown adipose tissue, either by increasing their expression or preventing the fall occurring during the pair-feeding regimen.
Relative UCP expression levels were 100, 104, and 33 for UCP1, 100, 191, and 125 for UCP2 and 100, 107, and 29 for UCP3 in ad libitum fed control rats, in leptin-treated rats and in pair-fed control rats, respectively
These results suggest that the overall effect of leptin on glucose utilization and on the expression of UCPs may be mediated through central mechanism!
During wk 6, milk yield and dry matter intake (DMI) were recorded daily, and plasma concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, urea, protein, growth hormone, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, oxytocin, and prolactin were determined!
The beta amyloid protein fragments had diverse effects on phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) as assayed in rat cortical membranes!
Activity and expression of the three UCP's are stimulated by several neuromediators and hormones such as noradrenaline, tri-iodothyronine and leptin!
Possible central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms could mediate these responses in that leptin receptors are located on hypothalamic neurons that coexpress neuropeptide-Y (NPY) or proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and both peptides that have been implicated as mediators of the CNS action of leptin.
Leptin has been demonstrated to decrease or down regulate NPY expression and increase POMC expression!
These results suggest that APP-S secretion and A beta production in NT2N neurons are regulated by the muscarinic/phospholipase C signal transduction pathway!
Insulin secretion, inositol phosphate levels, and phospholipase C isozymes in rodent pancreatic islets
These findings are consistent with the concept that the underexpression of the nutrient-activated PLC isozyme may account for the minimal inositol phosphate (IP) and second-phase insulin secretory response from mouse islets!
We have studied the effects of neomycin, a potent inhibitor of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC), on the germination of rice seed and the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in the aleurone layer and the scutellar tissues
It was shown that, in the absence of exogenous Ca2+, neomycin markedly reduced the germination speed and seedling growth of rice seeds and inhibited the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase in both secretory tissues
These results strongly suggest that the phosphoinositide-Ca2+ signal transduction pathway may play an important role in the gibberellin-induced expression of alpha-amylase molecules closely related to the germination processes of rice seed!
